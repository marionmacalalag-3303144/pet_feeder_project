## 📌 Contents

- **System Flowchart**  
  A visual representation of the logical flow of operations within the automated pet feeder system. It outlines the sequence of actions, decision points, and system responses from start to finish.

---

## 🔄 Overview

The flowchart illustrates:

- Initialization of system components
- Input checks (e.g., time, food level, pet presence)
- Decision-making logic (e.g., whether to dispense food)
- Output actions (e.g., motor activation, alert generation)
- Logging and standby procedures

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The flowchart serves as a blueprint for system behavior, helping developers and stakeholders understand how the system operates under various conditions. It supports:

- Clear communication of logic
- Easier debugging and refinement
- Smooth transition to coding and implementation

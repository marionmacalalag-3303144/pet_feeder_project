# 📁 Step 2 – Define Inputs, Outputs, and Operational Parameters

This folder contains the deliverables for **Step 2** of the assignment: *System Specification and Parameter Definition*.

---

## 📌 Contents

The following item is included in this folder:

- **Data Table**  
  A comprehensive table listing:
  - **Inputs** to the system (e.g., sensors, user settings)
  - **Outputs** from the system (e.g., motor actions, notifications)
  - **Operational Parameters** such as timing intervals, thresholds, and control logic

---

## 📊 Overview

This step focuses on identifying and organizing the technical components of the automated pet feeder system. The data table provides clarity on:

- What data the system receives and processes
- What actions the system performs in response
- The conditions and constraints under which the system operates

---

## 🧠 Purpose

Defining inputs, outputs, and operational parameters ensures that the system behaves predictably and meets user requirements. This step bridges the gap between conceptual design and implementation.
